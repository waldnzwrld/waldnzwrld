This guide is meant to be somewhat of a H.U.G (Human User Guide) and somewhat of a reference to my particular management style. 

#### About me ‚ò†Ô∏è üé∏ ‚úàÔ∏è

You may have noticed me around the company because of my love of all things Skeletor. Myaaaaah
Hi, My name is Walden. 

- My family started when I was much younger so I am not only a proud parent, but a doting grandfather as well. 
- I have been with GitHub for quite some time. I am a self taught software engineer with a background in several engineering fields. Over the years I have been a civil engineer, electrical engineer, I briefly attended school for chemical engineering, and I have a degree in sound design and studio engineering.
- I have lived in a lot of places around the world, but I currently reside in the Pacific northwest (Portland metro area to be specific)
- In order to keep my mind occupied in my personal life, my hobbies include playing and recording music, sailing, and I grow and care for some ~35 bonsai
- Hablo Espa√±ol, si quieres q charlar conmigo en este idioma. 
- Barbecue and hot sauce enthusiast. 
- Prior to GitHub, I worked at New Relic, and prior to that in a remote position for Apple.
