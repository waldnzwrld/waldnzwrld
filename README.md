## Manager README üï¥Ô∏è


This guide is meant to be somewhat of a H.U.G (Human User Guide) and somewhat of a reference to my particular management style. 

#### About me ‚ò†Ô∏è üé∏ ‚úàÔ∏è

You may have noticed me around the company because of my love of all things Skeletor. Myaaaaah
Hi, My name is Walden. 

- My family started when I was much younger so I am not only a proud parent, but a doting grandfather as well. 
- I have been with GitHub for quite some time. I am a self taught software engineer with a background in several engineering fields. Over the years I have been a civil engineer, electrical engineer, I briefly attended school for chemical engineering, and I have a degree in sound design and studio engineering.
- I have lived in a lot of places around the world, but I currently reside in the Pacific northwest (Portland metro area to be specific)
- In order to keep my mind occupied in my personal life, my hobbies include playing and recording music, sailing, and I grow and care for some ~35 bonsai
- Hablo Espa√±ol, si quieres q charlar conmigo en este idioma. 
- Barbecue and hot sauce enthusiast. 
- Prior to GitHub, I worked at New Relic, and prior to that in a remote position for Apple.


#### As a manager

As a manager my focal points encompass the following:

- Win, Win, Win strategies. Identifying areas where my team, our customers, and our business are all covered and gain the greatest benefit.
- Cross team communication and collaboration.
- Driving success while promoting an inclusive, happy, and balanced environment. 

My strategy to achieve those goals:

- Trust in my team and their capabilities. Listen to, trust in, and respect their assessments and decisions.
- Set clear and reasonable expectations for myself and the team. Honor and meet those expectations, and assist the team however possible in meeting the set expectations.
- Open clear lines of communication between myself and managers of collaborative teams. Clearly express team needs and maintain constructive and open dialogue with any other teams that we need to interface with.
- Tactically aligning any of my duties to coordinate and boost team members specific career focus and goals.
- Maintaining a sense of duty, while also keeping things light friendly and fun.
- Focusing on work / life balance. In my personal life I've always said "A happy parent is a good parent" but I believe this to be applicable in most scenarios. If you are feeling fulfilled in yourself, you will have space to promote your best self.
